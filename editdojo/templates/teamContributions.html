    <h3>QA Lead</h3>
    <h4>Koh Fang Ting</h4>
    <p>
        Fang Ting was assigned the role of a QA lead where she leads her QA members. In this team however, there is
        only one other QA member. Therefore, not only is she required to work on the testing just like a QA member,
        she also had to lead the other QA member in the team and provide clear instructions and tasks for that member
        to work on. She came up with the test cases and monitors the commits by the developers so that she can make
        changes to her test cases.
